# Assignment 4

Working with ajax.

You are going to use ajax (vanilla js or jQuery) to make a request, loop through the results in the response object and 
display the results in the HTML.

You must style the whole page on your own. You don't need to go overboard, but put a little effort into it.

The url for the api request is http://www.mattbowytz.com/simple_api.json

There are a few different query parameters to get different data. You MUST have one query parameter on the end of the url.

They are: `?data=all`, `?data=interests`, `?data=programming`, `?data=comics`

Let me know if you have any questions, we will be going over this through example in class before this assignment. The 
template files included should be enough to jog your memory.
